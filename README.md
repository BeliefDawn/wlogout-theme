# wlogout-theme
A css file of wlogout which I think is good

Please copy the style.css file and the layout file to ~/.config/wlogout/
And start the wlogout with command:
wlogout --protocol layer-shell -b 5

For icons, please find them your selves and put it in ~/.config/wlogout/icons
you need to rename them

or you can do 
cp -r /usr/share/wlogout/icons ~/.config/wlogout/icons
for using the deafult icons
